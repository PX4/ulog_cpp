# C++ ULog Library

Streamed C++ [ULog](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/dev_log/ulog_file_format.html) reader and writer library.

## Properties
- Options for keeping log data in memory or processing immediately.
- Pure C++17 without additional dependencies (`SimpleWriter` requires platform-specific `fsync`/`FlushFileBuffers`).
- The reader is ~10 times as fast compared to the [python implementation](https://github.com/PX4/pyulog).
  However, the API is more low-level, and if you're just looking for an easy-to-use parsing library, use pyulog.
- Unsupported ULog features:
  - Appended data (`DATA_APPENDED`)
- A little endian target machine is required (an error is thrown if this is not the case)
- The reader keeps errors stored, so parsing can be continued and any errors can be read out at the end.
  The writer directly throws exceptions (`ulog_cpp::ExceptionBase`).

## Examples
Check the [examples](examples) subdirectory.

## Include in a project
To add the library as a submodule with cmake, use the following steps:
```shell
git submodule add https://github.com/PX4/ulog_cpp.git ulog_cpp
```
Then extend your `CMakeLists.txt` with:
```cmake
add_subdirectory(ulog_cpp)

target_link_libraries(YOUR_PROJECT PUBLIC
  ulog_cpp::ulog_cpp
)
```

## Development
For development, install the pre-commit scripts:
```shell
pre-commit install
```

### CI
CI runs a number of checks which can be executed locally with the following commands.

#### clang-tidy
```shell
cd build
make clang-tidy
```

#### Unit tests
```shell
cd build
make run-unit-tests
```

#### Linters (code formatting etc)
These run automatically when committing code. To manually run them, use:
```shell
pre-commit run -a
```
